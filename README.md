This repository contains the final project we completed for the Big Data Analytics course (our team consists of Katerina Loizidi, Marios Christodoulou, Theos Kounias, and Neophytos Stylianou). The goal of the project was to perform both Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and more advanced analytical tasks using Apache Spark. We worked with a large dataset of Amazon book reviews around 3 million in total.

Each record in the dataset includes a user ID, book ID, rating, review text, and summary, along with metadata like book title, author, category, and publication date. Since the dataset contains a mix of numerical, categorical, and text data, it was a great fit for the types of analysis we wanted to explore.

We began with exploratory analysis using Spark DataFrames to examine the structure of the data, check for missing values, and understand patterns like rating distributions, review lengths, and popular books. We also created some visualizations to support this part of the analysis and help us better understand the overall dataset.

For the advanced analysis, we focused on three main areas. First, we built a classification model to identify sentiment in the review texts, labeling them as either positive or negative. Then, we applied K Means clustering to group similar books based on metadata and review behavior, which revealed some interesting patterns in reader preferences. Finally, we created a recommendation system using Sparkâ€™s ALS (Alternating Least Squares) algorithm to suggest books to users based on their past interactions. We evaluated the recommendation model using RMSE to get a sense of how well it performed.

On the text analysis side, we used standard NLP preprocessing steps like tokenization, removing stopwords, and TF IDF. This helped us turn the review text into structured features for modeling and gave us a better view of common themes and language used in reviews across different rating levels.
